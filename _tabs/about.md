## Introduction

My name is Abdalrhman, and I am a junior Programmer that is quite passionate about what he does. I have a significant pry for learning new concepts or technologies that I am curious about and I am actively doing my best to improve my skills.

### Background

I am currently a high school student and will soon be a university student. I do not have much professional experience at the moment because I am focusing on my studies and on improving my technical skills to become a competent programmer.
